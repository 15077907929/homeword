思路分析的第一步是分析题目。就本题而言，主题分别是学生和校长，因此要注意使用礼貌用语和正式用语；主题内容要包括建议的具体内容。
第二步是头脑风暴。将提出的具体建议列出来，如增加体育课课时、丰富体育课课程、组织一些课外体育活动等。
第三步是组织语言。这封信是写给校长的，要注意语言表达，首先要表示荣幸，之后再提出建议。
写作的逻辑顺序一般为开门见山说出目的，之后说出内容，最后希望自己的建议被采纳。

Honorable President,
	I am privileged to write to you about how to improve students' physical condition on our campus.My proposals are as follows.
	Firstly,since students are not getting enough workouts,I think it is essential that out school arrange adequate PE lessons
in per week courses,giving us more opportunities to strengthen our body.Secondly,I propose that we should add a variety of PE
courses,such as swimming,bowling,and yoga,which will stimulate mass participation in sports.Finally,I hope that our university
can regularly organize a large number of extracurricular activities.
	I hope the above suggestions could be token and the health conditions of our college students could be improved considerably.
																											Yours sincerely,
																													Li Ming
