第一段描述图画内容，在第二段阐释意义，最后发表评论，升华主题。

	The cartoon consists of two pictures.The left one shows that a young mother was holding her little daughter's hand 30 years
ago.The right one portarys the current situation.The mother has become old and the daughter,who has grown up to be a young lady,
is supporting her mother by her arm.
	The cartoon is thought-provoking and touching.The cartoonist wants to remind people that when we are young,our parents care
for us and devote much of their time and energy to us.For children,parents are our strongest support.As we grow up,parents get
old and no longer strong enough.It is time we supported and accompanied them so that we can pay their love back.
	In my opinion,filial piety has always been the fine tradition in China.We have been told since childhood to respect the 
seniority,especially our parents who bring us up.With parents' love we can grow up safe and healthy.That is why we should let 
them feel our love and gratitude and live a happy life.Moreover,by creating more happy families we can contribute to the 
formation of a harmonious society.
